President Barack Obama arrived in refugee-flooded Jordan on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">Friday</TIMEX3> after scoring a diplomatic coup just before leaving Israel when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">a 2010</TIMEX3> commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla.

The apology, long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East.

It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">minutes</TIMEX3> before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president's Middle East swing. It is the first foreign trip of his second term.

A statement from Netanyahu's office said the apology included an offer of compensation. However, there was confusion later when the Israeli government dropped a reference in its original statement to normalized relations between the countries with a return of ambassadors.

There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the flotilla raid.

Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops. Later, however, its amended statement omitted that action as well.
