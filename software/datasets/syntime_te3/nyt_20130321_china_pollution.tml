China's state leadership transition has taken place <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">this month</TIMEX3> against an ominous backdrop. More than 16,000 dead pigs have been found floating in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, causing convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she checked for smog <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">every morning</TIMEX3> after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him "quite upset" and vowed to "show even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts" to clean it up.

<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">Last month</TIMEX3>, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">years</TIMEX3>. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">four years ago</TIMEX3>. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">2011</TIMEX3>, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

On <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">Feb. 28</TIMEX3>, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note saying that China's current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">the next decade</TIMEX3>. "China's air pollution will become a lot worse from the already unbearable level," the analysts said, calling for drastic policy changes and "a strong government will to overcome the opposition from interest groups."

The report estimated that the number of passenger cars in China was on track to hit 400 million by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">2030</TIMEX3>, up from 90 million <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2021-05-18">now</TIMEX3>.
